## Description

### Problem we are solving
Traditional credit systems are unfair to students. Most students don’t have jobs, credit histories, or assets — but many of them will be high earners in a few years. These students either get denied loans or are charged insanely high interest rates.

### Solution
A student-focused lending platform that helps students get access to money based on their future potential, not just their current financial situation.

Instead of relying purely on a credit score, we look at how good of a student you are. We use your college transcript and resume to understand your background, verify it’s real, and then estimate how much you’re likely to make after graduation. Based on that, we decide how much you can borrow and what your interest rate should be.

The better your predicted future income, the more you can borrow today — and at better rates.
